## Cost

The real estimate varies from the below equations but not by much.

### Blockchain Analysis
Preliminary report – brief analysis report to get the big picture which is free of charge.

The analysis itself – analysis with several tools from our tech stack (Arkham, etc.). We investigate further into suspect wallet addresses and provide detailed next steps. 

Time - on average, it takes < 72 hours for prelim report to be delivered. The full completion of a case depends solely on the complexity. We try to take all these factors into account during the project estimation.


Cost of the report = Number of suspect addresses (determined from prelim report) / 200 * 1.5 * the cost of one working day of the team. 

### Writing
I do not know _everything_. Hence, I take time to thoroughly research and read as much as possible to create high-quality pieces. 

Though cost doesn't change, the time taken may vary depending on how complex of a topic it is. 


Cost per article = Number of words/ 200 * 1.5 * the cost of one working day of the team.
